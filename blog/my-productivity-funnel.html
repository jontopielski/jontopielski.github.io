     The productivity funnel

    <p>
     When I get poor sleep, I pretty much can't get anything done. Even if I go for a jog, chug a bunch of coffee, and eat a healthy, lean meal, I will still struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet even on other days when I have had good sleep, ate well, and exercised I can still find myself distracted and not be able to work effectively, even if it's a day that I want to get work done.
    </p>
    <p>
     So why is that? I believe there's a certain "hierarchy" of what the next blocker to being able to work effectively is. And that hierarchy changes over time. I believe that everyone has their own hierarchy, whether they realize it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     An extreme example of this is if you have the flu. You of course aren't going to work as effectively because you're not well. But imagine you forgot you had the flu and couldn't figure out why you couldn't get any work done. So you rigorously exercise, eat the cleanest whole foods you can find, get the highest quality sleep you can, all in the name of trying to be able to work, and you still can't. But all you had to do was go to the store and buy some medicine and you would have been better.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've wasted a lot of time trying to read productivity books in order to figure out how to work more effectively, when in reality I had an underlying sleep issue and that was the main blocker for me. Everything else was further down the "funnel" and I should have addressed this layer first before anything else. Once passed this layer of the funnel, I can start thinking about how to organize my work, how diet and exercise will give me more energy, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     My funnel is very simple:
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep (for me, using CPAP) -&gt; "productivity" stuff (ex: no internet at home) -&gt; mental health (can't do much if stressed) -&gt; general health (vitamin levels, etc) -&gt; attention disorder (mostly caffeine, but sometimes medication) -&gt; diet (not overeating in evenings) -&gt; exercise
    </p>
    <p>
     If this concept seems very obvious, perhaps it is. But I've found it helpful to use this funnel concept as a lens to question whether something work-related is something I should truly focus on or if there's something more pressing I should be addressing first.
