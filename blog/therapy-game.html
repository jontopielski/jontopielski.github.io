     The making of my "microtherapy" game

    <p>
     Last week, I released a game with the wordy title,
     <a href="https://jontopielski.itch.io/microtherapy">
      microtherapy for when you overthink a comment you made
     </a>
     . In it, you answer a few questions, receive some insights, and then draw and purge an embarassing comment you might have said from your mind.
    </p>

     Of course, this is quite different from the kinds of games I usually make. Normally, I focus on fun, strategic decision making, or aesthetics and this game really has none of that. After I released it, a couple of friends have asked me what my inspiration was for it so I thought I'd talk a bit about that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, I made the game for a game jam who's theme had to do with this concept of "perception boxes", or how we perceive the world around us based on the [ box ] of our own lived experiences. When I first saw the theme, I was ready to dismiss it for being a little too specific and real-worldy. But then I took an extra moment to think seriously if there was anything going on in my life that might be relevant.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    </div>
    <p>
     And that's when I realized that yes, I was currently overthinking several (not just one) things that I said at some point to friends or family in the weeks prior that occasionally popped up while I was trying to go to sleep. Yes, they were silly, mindless comments that we all make and to be honest I can't even remember what I said at this point. But I knew then that they were causing me a little bit of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, I wondered if there was something I could do with this disturbed feeling and make a game around that. And that's when I thought back to a game I had played a few years ago where you got to draw (or type) a message onto a paper, put it inside of a glass bottle, and drop it into a river that gets dumped into the ocean. I can't remember the game's name but I remember playing it and feeling a bit better after releasing a nagging thought into the wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     I decided to try to make a game like this but for my comment anxiety. I thought I'd also include a section where you got to answer a few questions before you actually purge your negative thought (like a therapy session). I typed up some questions into a Google spreadsheet and then I manually "played" the game by thinking of an embarassing comment myself and going through the sequence of questions to see if it actually helped me.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img class="artPanel" src="../posts\11-therapy-game\sheet.png" width="50%"/>
    </div>
    <p>
     Surprisingly enough, it kinda worked! I did feel a bit better after answering the questions and hearing some advice (even though I was the one who
     <em>
      wrote
     </em>
     the questions and advice). Now all I had to do was translate the questions into Godot and build the drawing and purging part.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the canvas, I decided to keep things really simple and just have drawing and erasing via the mouse. I considered having a textbox too but decided it would be too much work. After all, I only gave myself a few days to work on this. I created a blank canvas inside of a SubViewport in Godot (with Viewport clearing every frame turned off) and that was pretty much all I needed to be able to draw freely.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
     For the purging, I decided to go with a very simple custom "particle" system - basically just instantiating a circle at a certain point that moves upwards, shrinks, and then deletes itself. Spawning a bunch of these with slight changes to their parameters was enough to make it look vaguely smoke-esque.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    </div>
    <p>
     I still didn't know if purging a drawing would actually make you feel better. I couldn't test the theory until the project was basically done. For all I knew, it could have done absolutely nothing or maybe even made things worse. But yet again, I tested it myself and somehow it worked and made me feel better, even if a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     In all honesty, I thought nobody would play this game or get it and I even debated releasing it on an anonymous account. My criteria was if one person was helped even to the smallest degree, it will have been worth putting out. And thankfully, I succeeded in that at least several people seemed to have been helped by the project:

     Finally, I attempted to make music for it, which I'm pretty bad at. But if you want to give it a listen, the two very short (and simple) songs can be found here:
