In the beginning of this month, I participated in my first 7-day rogue-like jam (7DRL for short) and released [Echo Chamber](https://jontopielski.itch.io/echo-chamber), a turn-based game where you combo different spells while traversing a dungeon. Mafgar assisted with all things audio and I used a tile set called mrmotext by Mrmo Tarius.
