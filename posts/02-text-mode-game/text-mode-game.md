In the beginning of this month, I participated in my first 7-day rogue-like jam ([7DRL](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2022) for short) and released [Echo Chamber](https://jontopielski.itch.io/echo-chamber), a turn-based game where you combo different spells while traversing a dungeon. [Mafgar](https://twitter.com/mafgar_online) assisted with all things audio and I used a tile set called [mrmotext](https://mrmotarius.itch.io/mrmotext) by [Mrmo Tarius](https://mrmotarius.itch.io/).
