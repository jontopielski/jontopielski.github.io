title: Ludum Dare 50 Retrospective
date: April 27 2022

Since my first ever game jam roughly 3 years ago, I’ve learned a lot. And yet, things still don’t seem to be getting much easier. Shouldn’t they be getting easier?

This post is both a retrospective for my most recent Ludum Dare I participated in, as well as some things I’ve learned over the years. Hope it’s helpful to someone out there.
