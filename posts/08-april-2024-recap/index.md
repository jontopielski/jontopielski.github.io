April was my return to game dev after a 2-month hiatus while I moved back to San Francisco. I returned for Ludum Dare and released a tiny desktop pet called [Desktop Daemon](https://jontopielski.itch.io/desktop-daemon).

It was fun to work on a project that didn't require a lot of content - Desktop Daemon is literally just a stacked sprite and some 2d animations. It trots around your screen and occasionally does spirals. You can pet it.

I also started working on a project for the [Playdate](https://play.date/) called "The Sweetest Sound". It's a game about remembering peoples' names and it's only a few minutes long. I'm building the game in the [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/) engine (similar to [Bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/)), which is a tiny tile-based engine that lives in your browser and requires very little programming.

I've also resumed my "longer term" project (still pretty short) - a game about sleep called "Pillow Fight". I'm hoping to release it in early June as a submission to [Glow Up Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/glow-up-game-jam), a game jam that I'm also hosting! It will likely be a free release at first with a potential follow up patch that adds more gameplay and then might cost a few bucks. Stay tuned!
